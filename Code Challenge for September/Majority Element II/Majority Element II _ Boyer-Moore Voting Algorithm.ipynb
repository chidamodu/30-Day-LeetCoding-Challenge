    "times in an array of length n.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to have two variables, one holding a potential candidate for majority element and a counter to keep \n",
    "track of whether to swap a potential candidate or not. Why can we get away with only two variables? Because there can \n",
    "be at most one majority element which is more than ⌊n/2⌋ times. Therefore, having only one variable to hold the only \n",
    "potential candidate and one counter is enough.\n",

    "next will become the potential candidate. Keep doing this procedure while scanning the array. \n",
    "However, when you have exhausted the array, you have to make sure that the element recorded in the potential \n",
    "candidate variable is the majority element by checking whether it occurs more than ⌊n/2⌋ times in the array. \n",
    "In the original Majority Element problem, it is guaranteed that there is a majority element in the array so your \n",
    "implementation can omit the second pass. However, in a general case, you need this second pass since your array can \n",
    "have no majority elements at all!\n",
    "\n",
    "The counter is initialized as 0 and the potential candidate as None at the start of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an element is truly a majority element, it will stick in the potential candidate variable, no matter how it shows \n",
    "up in the array (i.e. all clustered in the beginning of the array, all clustered near the end of the array, or \n",
    "showing up anywhere in the array), after the whole array has been scanned. Of course, while you are scanning the \n",
    "array, the element might be replaced by another element in the process, but the true majority element will \n",
    "definitely remain as the potential candidate in the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now figuring out the majority elements which show up more than ⌊n/3⌋ times is not that hard anymore. Using the \n",
