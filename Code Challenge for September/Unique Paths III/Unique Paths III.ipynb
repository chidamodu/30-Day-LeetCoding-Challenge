    "Answer Explanation:\n",
    "    \n",
    "If you look carefully at your problem constraints: m*n <= 20, where m and n your grid sizes, we can guess, that we need to use dfs in this problem: that is try to check all possible options. So, we need to do several steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Find our starting point: traverse all grid and find cell with value 1. Also count number of cells we need to visit, \n",
    "I denoted them empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, use recursive dfs(x,y, rest) function, where x and y are current coordinates in our cell and rest is how many \n",
    "empty cells we need to traverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.1 First we check if we can move to the current cell: if it is outside our grid and it is already visited or have \n",
    "obstacle, we return\n",
    "\n",
    "2.2 If current cell is end cell and we already visited all cells, we add 1 to self.ans.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.3 Define list of neighbours and for each of them run our dfs: mark visited cell with -2 and then mark it back when \n",
    "we go outside recursion. It is important to do this, because in python grid is global variable and we need to change \n",
    "it back.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we just run dfs(sx, sy, empty - 1), where (sx, sy) is coordinates of starting cell and return self.ans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: \n",
    "Space complexity is O(mn), this is the possible biggest length of our recursion stack. \n",
    "Time complexity is O(3^(mn)), because on each step (except first) we have no more than 3 options to go: all directions except direction we came from. In practice however it will work much faster than this estimate because of big number of dead-ends\n",
