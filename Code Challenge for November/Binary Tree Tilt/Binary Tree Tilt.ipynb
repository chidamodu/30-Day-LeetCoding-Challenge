    "\n",
    "The overall idea is that we traverse each node, and calculate the tilt value for each node. At the end, we sum up all \n",
    "the tilt values, which is the desired result of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are in general two strategies to traverse a tree data structure, namely Breadth-First Search (BFS) and \n",
    "Depth-First Search (DFS).\n",
    "\n",
    "Concerning the DFS strategy, it can further be divided into three categories: Pre-Order, In-Order and Post-Order, \n",
    "depending on the relative order of visit among the node and its children nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, both strategies could work for a specific problem. In other cases, one of them might be more adapted to \n",
    "the problem. In our case here, the DFS is a more optimized choice, as one will see later. More specifically, we could \n",
    "apply the Post-Order DFS traversal here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed before, in order to calculate the tilt value for a node, we need to calculate the sum of its left and \n",
    "right subtrees respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us first implement the function valueSum(node) which returns the sum of values for all nodes starting from the \n",
    "given node, which can be summarized with the following recursive formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "valueSum(node)=node.val+valueSum(node.left)+valueSum(node.right)\n",
    "valueSum(node)=node.val+valueSum(node.left)+valueSum(node.right)\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the tilt value of a node also depends on the value sum of its left and right subtrees, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "tilt(node)=∣valueSum(node.left)−valueSum(node.right)∣\n",
    "tilt(node)=∣valueSum(node.left)−valueSum(node.right)∣\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, we could combine the above calculations within a single recursive function. In this way, we only need to \n",
    "traverse each node once and only once.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, we will traverse the tree in the post-order DFS, i.e. we visit a node's left and right subtrees \n",
    "before processing the value of the current node.\n",
