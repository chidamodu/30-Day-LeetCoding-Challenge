    "one.\n",
    "\n",
    "As easy as it sounds, the above intuition could lead to quite some variants of implementation. For instance, to \n",
    "retrieve the right-most bit in an integer n, one could either apply the modulo operation (i.e. n % 2) or the bit AND \n",
    "operation (i.e. n & 1). Another example would be that in order to combine the results of reversed bits (e.g. \n",
    "\n",
    "2^a, 2^b), one could either use the addition operation (i.e. 2^a + 2^b) or again the bit OR operation (i.e. 2^a âˆ£ 2^b).\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we show on example of implementation based on the above intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea is that for a bit that is situated at the index i, after the reversion, its position should be 31-i \n",
    "(note: the index starts from zero).\n",
    "We iterate through the bit string of the input integer, from right to left (i.e. n = n >> 1). To retrieve the \n",
    "right-most bit of an integer, we apply the bit AND operation (n & 1). \n",
    "\n",
    "For each bit, we reverse it to the correct position (i.e. (n & 1) << power). Then we accumulate this reversed bit to \n",
    "the final result. \n",
    "\n",
    "When there is no more bits of one left (i.e. n == 0), we terminate the iteration. "
